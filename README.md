### Gesture Recognition using Webcam and CNN ###

I worked with a partner, Khalid Brelvi, to generate the IEEE Format report: GestureRecognitionUsingWebcamAndCNN.pdf
This report compares custom built and trained CNN's (Brelvi) and a transfer learning approach to hand gesture recognition on our own dataset (Connell).

You can view the source code in GestureRecognitionModel.ipynb and the runnable file is RunModel.ipynb

This will not work unless you generate your own data and retrain, but the full source code is available. 

For a summary of results, view HandGestureRecognitionPPT in the repo.
